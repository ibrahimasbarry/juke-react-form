Oh, hello!

I am a simple starter set for building a React app! I use a cool program called `webpack-dev-server` in my start script. It serves up all of the files in the directory (just like `http-server`), with the added bonus of running `webpack` as well!

To start using me, here's what you'll have to do:

* `npm install`
* `npm start`

Any changes you make should cause `webpack-dev-server` to rebuild - check the output in the terminal to make sure that everything builds properly before you refresh the page though!
